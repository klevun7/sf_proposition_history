# City of San Francisco Historic Ballot Measures Explorer ðŸŒ‰

This project provides an interactive web application to explore historic ballot measures and propositions within the City of San Francisco. It allows users to view detailed information about each measure, visualize voting results with dynamic charts, and access all content in multiple languages for enhanced accessibility. The client is built using NextJS with React, using `i18n` for language accessibility and `ChartJS` for data visualizations. The backend is a PHP server, that serves as an API to send data from the `MySQL` database running on `XAMMP` to the client-side.
